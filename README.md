# ComfyUI Custom Node Skills

A curated collection of agent skills (for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) and [OpenAI Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/build-skills)) for developing ComfyUI custom nodes. These skills give the agent comprehensive knowledge of the ComfyUI node system, covering both the V3 (recommended) and V1 (legacy) APIs.

The `SKILL.md` files follow the open [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) standard and are shared by both agents — install once, works everywhere.

## Installation

### Claude Code

#### Plugin Marketplace (recommended)

In Claude Code, open the marketplace and add this repository URL. This installs the `comfyui-custom-nodes` plugin, which exposes all 9 skills automatically — no manual copying required.

#### Personal (all projects)

```bash
# Clone the repository, then copy the skills to your personal skills directory
git clone https://github.com/jtydhr88/comfyui-custom-node-skills.git
cp -r comfyui-custom-node-skills/plugins/comfyui-custom-nodes/skills/comfyui-node-* ~/.claude/skills/
```

#### Project-specific

```bash
# Copy skills into your ComfyUI custom node project
cp -r comfyui-custom-node-skills/plugins/comfyui-custom-nodes/skills/comfyui-node-* /path/to/your-project/.claude/skills/
```

#### Verify

Skills are loaded automatically when Claude detects relevant context. You can also check they're available:

```
> /skills
```

### Codex (CLI / ChatGPT desktop app / IDE extension)

#### Plugin marketplace (recommended)

```bash
# Add this repository as a Codex marketplace source
codex plugin marketplace add jtydhr88/comfyui-custom-node-skills

# Then, in the ChatGPT desktop app or Codex CLI:
# Plugins → select "ComfyUI Custom Node Skills" → Install
```

The same 9 `SKILL.md` files are shipped through the plugin's `skills/` directory — no duplication, no rewriting.

#### Personal skills (all projects)

```bash
# Clone the repository, then copy the skills to your personal skills directory
git clone https://github.com/jtydhr88/comfyui-custom-node-skills.git
cp -r comfyui-custom-node-skills/plugins/comfyui-custom-nodes/skills/comfyui-node-* ~/.agents/skills/
```

#### Project-specific

```bash
# Copy skills into your ComfyUI custom node project
mkdir -p .agents/skills
cp -r comfyui-custom-node-skills/plugins/comfyui-custom-nodes/skills/comfyui-node-* .agents/skills/
```

#### Verify

In Codex, run `/skills` to list available skills, or invoke one explicitly with `$comfyui-node-basics`.

### GitHub Copilot

#### Automatic (cloud and local VSCode)

Skills are loaded automatically when working in this repository — no setup needed. The `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file is read automatically by GitHub Copilot in both cloud and local VSCode contexts.

#### Plugin marketplace (Copilot CLI — recommended)

```bash
# Register the marketplace (once)
copilot plugin marketplace add jtydhr88/comfyui-custom-node-skills

# Browse and install
copilot plugin marketplace browse comfyui-custom-node-skills
copilot plugin install comfyui-custom-nodes@comfyui-custom-node-skills
```

#### Direct install (Copilot CLI)

```bash
copilot plugin install jtydhr88/comfyui-custom-node-skills:plugins/comfyui-custom-nodes
```

#### Verify

```
/skills list
```

## Usage Examples

```
# "Create a basic V3 node with an image input and a float slider"
# → agent uses comfyui-node-basics + comfyui-node-inputs

# "Add a preview image output to my node"
# → agent uses comfyui-node-outputs

# "Migrate my V1 node to V3"
# → agent uses comfyui-node-migration

# "Add a sidebar tab with custom settings"
# → agent uses comfyui-node-frontend
```

## Key Features

- **V3 API First** — All examples use the modern V3 API (`io.ComfyNode`, `io.Schema`, `io.NodeOutput`)
- **V1 Reference** — Legacy V1 patterns documented for migration and backward compatibility
- **Source-Verified** — Cross-referenced against actual ComfyUI backend and frontend source code
- **Complete Coverage** — From basic node creation to advanced patterns like DynamicCombo and node expansion
- **Frontend Extensions** — Full JavaScript extension system with 15+ lifecycle hooks
- **Multi-agent** — Same `SKILL.md` files work in Claude Code and Codex (open agentskills.io standard)
